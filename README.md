# Business Understanding

## Overview
The global telecommunications industry is known for intense competition and unpredictable business conditions, making it challenging for less resilient companies. Customer retention fluctuates dramatically due to factors such as economic downturns, rising costs, competitive alternatives, rapid technological advancements, globalization, government intervention, and various other influences.

## Problem Statement
Syria Telecommunications is grappling with the same challenges as other major telecom companies, but possibly at a more severe level. While the industry standard churn rate falls between 5% and 7%, Syria Telecommunications has seen its churn rate spike to nearly 15% at the time of data collection. In response, the company's management has tasked the Data Science Department with the responsibility of gathering, cleaning, and analyzing data to uncover the reasons behind this alarming rate and to propose practical solutions to address the issue.

## Business Problem
Despite the potential for booming profits and increased market share, Syria Telecommunications is experiencing a decline in customer retention. This downward trend threatens to steer the company away from its business objectives and hinder its growth.

## Objectives
To identify factors leading to increased churn rates

To create a classification model that predicts whether a customer will churn with a recall of over 80%

To give customer retention recommendations
